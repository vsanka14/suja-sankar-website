  title: About Me
  emoji: 👩‍🔬
  details: Hi there! I am Suja Sankar and  chemistry has been a lifelong passion
    of mine, sparked by an early fascination with the incredible ways it shapes
    our world. My journey began in childhood, inspired by my father and an
    exceptional chemistry teacher who brought science to life through hands-on
    experiments and real-world connections. Watching chemical reactions unfold
    before my eyes, I became captivated by the idea that chemistry is at the
    heart of everything we do and everything we are.
  funFact: Carbon is my favorite element because it’s the backbone of
    life—literally! Without it, we'd be in a real 'bind.
