  title: About Me
  emoji: 👩‍🔬
  details: Just like a catalyst speeds up a reaction, my passion is accelerating
    student understanding of chemistry. With over two decades of teaching
    experience, I've helped hundreds of students discover the amazing world of
    molecular interactions.
  funFact: Carbon is my favorite element because it’s the backbone of
    life—literally! Without it, we'd be in a real 'bind.
