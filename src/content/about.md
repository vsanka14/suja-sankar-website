    Hi there! I am Suja Sankar and  chemistry has been a lifelong passion of
    mine, sparked by an early fascination with the incredible ways it shapes our
    world. 


    My journey began in childhood, inspired by my father and an exceptional chemistry teacher who brought science to life through hands-on experiments and real-world connections. Watching chemical reactions unfold before my eyes, I became captivated by the idea that chemistry is at the heart of everything we do and everything we are.
  funFact: Carbon is my favorite element because it’s the backbone of
    life—literally! Without it, we'd be in a real 'bind.
