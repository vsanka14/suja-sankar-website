    Hi there! I am Suja Sankar and  chemistry has been a lifelong passion of
    mine, sparked by an early fascination with the incredible ways it shapes our
    world. My journey began in childhood, inspired by my father and an
    exceptional chemistry teacher who brought science to life through hands-on
    experiments and real-world connections. Watching chemical reactions unfold
    before my eyes, I became captivated by the idea that chemistry is at the
    heart of everything we do and everything we are.


    This deep-rooted love for chemistry has driven me to dedicate over 20 years to teaching and sharing my enthusiasm for the subject. Today, as an online tutor specializing in AP Chemistry, college Chemistry, and advanced high school Chemistry, I strive to create that same sense of wonder in my students. My goal is to make chemistry accessible, engaging, and relevant, whether through one-on-one sessions or small group discussions on Zoom. I believe that every student has the potential to master chemistry, and I’m here to guide them with patience, encouragement, and a commitment to their success.I would like to be a catalyst in accelerating your chemistry learning!


    In my sessions, I emphasize critical thinking and problem-solving skills, helping students not only understand chemistry but also develop a lifelong confidence in STEM. With interactive tools, carefully crafted study materials, and personalized support, I’m here to show students just how transformative and exciting chemistry can be.
  funFact: Carbon is my favorite element because it’s the backbone of
    life—literally! Without it, we'd be in a real 'bind.
