    Hi! I'm Suja Sankar, and chemistry has been a lifelong passion. My journey
    began in childhood, sparked by my father and an inspiring chemistry teacher
    who showed me the fascinating ways science shapes our world. Captivated by
    the reactions I observed, I knew chemistry was at the heart of everything.




    With over 20 years of teaching experience, I now specialize as an online tutor in AP Chemistry, college-level Chemistry, and advanced high school Chemistry. My goal is to make chemistry accessible, engaging, and relevant for my students, fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Through one-on-one sessions or small group discussions on Zoom, I work to build students’ confidence in STEM.




    I believe every student can master chemistry, and I’m here to guide them with patience, encouragement, and support. Thank you for visiting—I look forward to helping you explore the wonders of chemistry!
  funFact: Carbon is my favorite element because it’s the backbone of
    life—literally! Without it, we'd be in a real 'bind'.
